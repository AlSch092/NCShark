# What is this?
NCShark is a pcap driver powered packet logging tool made in C# (fork of MapleShark) for the game Night Crows. This program bypasses any anti-cheat mechanisms to bring you ban-free data logging.

# Limitations
- Data sending is prohibited in this project to prevent general abuse of the game servers.
- The program can become overwhelmed with data in areas of high inbound data activity (hundreds of entities moving nearby at once, for example)

# End note

Inevitably there will be users who attempt to monetize this project by making 'object/entity scanners'. Do not pay for cheats: if you do you are being ripped off and are likely supporting criminals. Bots/cheats made by 99% of people will also get you banned as the cheat maker likely has no proper experience/no deep skill, and will likely put malware onto your computer. Just say no to buying cheats.
